<p> Defend Bad Positions </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p> When you're in omoplata, roll and take side control. 
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p> When escaping the mount and his knees on your armpits. Push his hips and move back. Create space first <br/>
			Otherwise, too easy for them to escape your leg trap. 
		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p> You on your back, they're standing. Grab cross lapel with your right arm, and left arm back for support. <br/>
			They try to step around: you follow. When opponent passes both legs to your right -> pull hard with your right arm <br/>
			to take them down into turtle. Right hand goes on floor, left arm goes round to take back cross lapel. Left knee up. right knee down. <br/>

		<p> When escaping the mount and his knees on your armpits. Push his hips and move back. Create space first <br/>

		<p> You on your back, they're standing. Grab cross lapel with your right arm, and left arm back for support. <br/>
			They try to step around: you follow. When opponent passes both legs to your right -> pull hard with your right arm <br/>
			to take them down into turtle. Right hand goes on floor, left arm goes round to take back cross lapel. Left knee up. right knee down. <br/>

			<br/> your elbow in. Then can shrimp out a bit more and then bring hips back to the middle, at the same time pushing their 
			<br/> knee away to create a lot of space. Keep their knee away. Shrimp to the left again, keeping their knee away <br/>

<p> Attack the back  </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p> When they in turtle and you are attacking their back, don't lean on them + be on your toes. <br/>
			Whatever hand goes through, same knee up, other knee down. e.g. left arm goes in to grab their right lapel <br/>
			Left knee will be up. Knees tight. Elbow tight + put elbow on your hip. Go round, pulling with your arm <br/>
			right knee ends up under his armpit. Sit back. Seatbelt your arms. 1 hook then the other. If can't <br/>
			get first hook - stretch him out first. <br/>
			<b>Option 2 :</b> If opponent won't budge or remains closed tight, change the grip on their right lapel<br/>
			to their right wrist. right hand on the back of their collar, pull them up and pull their wrist with your <br/>
			left hand to the left. right foot in, roll over right shoulder, brining right arm from collar over neck.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Armbar when they're face down. Can't get left arm through. Knees forward. Put his left arm over your left knee and push forward<br/>
			to make room<br/>
		</p>

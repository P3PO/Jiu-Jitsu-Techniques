<p> Attack the back  </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p> When they in turtle and you are attacking their back, don't lean on them + be on your toes. <br/>
			Whatever hand goes through, same knee up, other knee down. e.g. left arm goes in to grab their right lapel <br/>
			Left knee will be up. Knees tight. Elbow tight + put elbow on your hip. Go round, pulling with your arm <br/>
			right knee ends up under his armpit. Sit back. Seatbelt your arms. 1 hook then the other. If can't <br/>
			get first hook - stretch him out first. <br/>
			<b>Option 2 :</b> If opponent won't budge or remains closed tight, change the grip on their right lapel<br/>
			to their right wrist. right hand on the back of their collar, pull them up and pull their wrist with your <br/>
			left hand to the left. right foot in, roll over right shoulder, brining right arm from collar over neck.

	<li>
		<p>Armbar when they're face down. Can't get left arm through. Knees forward. Put his left arm over your left knee and push forward<br/>
			to make room<br/>

	<li>
		<p>Juji Gatame. When hand is through and towards his head. Can lean towards his head and lift hips to break their grip. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Exercise. You have their back, hooks in. Right arm over their shoulder, left under their arm -> get seatbelt grip. <br/>
			Whichever side you have overarm is side you fall towards. Keep tight throughout. Fall on your shoulder, not elbow. <br/>
			Overarm ontop of underarm in seatbelt grip. Fall to your right. They get your right hook off. Your left hook control<br/>
			their leg, dont lose the left hook. Bring right leg out from under his body, dont let it get trapped. Move it to their shoulder<br/>and press forward with your chest. Adjust grips. Use left hand to pull their lapel gi down and tighten and remove slack<br/>Right hand grab deep in their neck, and bring elbow towards your hip to tighten. Use left hand to go under his left arm<br/>
			and move it back as fall back,so they cant use it to slacken the gi. Fall to other side, pulling with hand to choke, create<br/>
			space so can put right foot on their shoulder and do okuri eri jime.<br/>
			Exercise variation: after falling to side,bringing your knee to their head, can just fall to the other side<br/>
			and rehook the leg. Can keep doing this, side to side, change seatbelt positions each time.

			Hip escape to your left. Bring right knee in. Left leg go up high, then across and put on their left hip <br/>
			Shrimp back straight. Use your hands to keep them away when doing it. Also if they're low on your body<br/>

	<li>
		<p>Trick - They're passing your guard to your right. Turn left into turtle. Keep left elbow on left knee <br/>
			tight so they can't get hooks in. Grab their right leg with your hand so they cant go over <br/>
			If their hand goes round to grab under your right arm, you need to <br/>
			push their shoulder first. Roll back and recover guard.

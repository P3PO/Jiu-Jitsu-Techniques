	<li>
		<p>You have them in half guard. Put right elbow on floor and use it to put your knees on the floor and turn. Get rid of their upper arm and take the back. Press with your arm around their back so no room for them to put their hand through underarm. If they get the underarm and post leg out to press into you, grab their leg, go under them and sweep them to the direction. Alternative 3 - can push into them and pull their knee to fall ontop of them.

		<p>2 half guard sweeps: You have their right leg in half guard. They get a knee out, stretch out their left leg to base and have their right hand on your lapel to push you down and flatten you. Grab their lapel with your right hand and use your legs and arm pull to push them forward, let go of collar. Left hand goes around their leg and grabs the left side(or right side which is closest) of their lower gi(untuck from their belt). Keep left arm tucked in throughout so they cant get an underarm and keep some distance so they cant grab your right arm. 1 - Open legs one over the other, grab collar to pull them forward and turn to take the back. 2 - if they're trying to pass by switching base to the other side. right arm goes under your leg and replaces your left arm to grab the gi. left arm grabs their far leg. Open guard, right leg hooks their leg, kick them as pull with right arm and take side control.

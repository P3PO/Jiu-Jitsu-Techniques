		<p> Whatever leg he's trapped, your heap goes on his hip that side. i.e. if he has your right leg, <br/>
			your face goes on his right side. Left arm goes under his leg, grab your own right wrist. Go down, <br/>
			keep hip low, kick right leg back to escape. right arm then grabs both of his legs - go into side control.

		<p>He half guards your right leg. Left arm round his head. Your head on his left side. Arm goes around his head <br/>
			and control tight with your elbow, keep his upper body down. Change your hip, knee out first. <br/>
			Other leg go up, control his hip. If can't get leg out, other leg keep one of his legs down.

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>He half guards your right leg. Left arm around his head deep. Left leg kick back so he cant grab knee. <br/>
			With your right hand, get his lapel out of his belt and pass it to your left hand, pressure on his head <br/>
			Move left knee down, get right knee out, then use ballerina foot to get foot out. <br/>

<p> Attacks from Mount Position </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Tip: Maintain Mount. One arm under his head and other arm posted. Hip pressure down. Hooks in. Knees barely touch ground.  <br/>
			Arm out in direction he's going. Hand which is out - knee open. Headlock hand side - hook leg side. Switch when they <br/>
			change direction. Hooks switch first, then switch hands. Stiff arm - when they try to wrap. Keep elbow where it is<br/>
			don't bring it in. Bring arm around to repost. Arm at 45 degrees. <br/>
			When opponent tries to push you up with both hands. Go from hooks to knees. Rest weight on his arms. <br/>
			Remove all weight from one shoulder. Bring arm inside. Slide through. Put hand down. Then other hand is light and can slip<br/>
			through. Get low immediately. <br/>
			IMPORTANT: When one arm starts going across - he wants to turn on his side. Change base to armbar position<br/>
			One knee next to his head. Hand out for support. As they continue to turn onto knees - slide hooks in and go back.<br/>
			Seatbelt - one hand under his armpit - other hand over his shoulder. Tip: Put weight on hand to switch easy as they go onto<br/>
			knees. Put weight on hands and toes to shift back easily. Shift back then do seatbelt. <br/>
			Choking IMPORTANT: Whichever way they turn, top hook must be strong. Keep hooks on inner thighs. OverUnder - keep <br/>
			head next to his. <br/>
			Remount: Remove bottom hook. Top hook over.  Remount. Pull bottom elbow down when remount. <br/>
			REAR NAKED CHOKE: Elbow like a V under their chin. Grab bicep inside and then backpalm behind head. <br/>
			Head next to theirs. Hug tight, pull + expand chest. Keep your head on the side that grabs bicep. Breathe. <br/>
			When choke - both hands are over shoulder. <br/>
			Better to fall on side with overarm. When fall to overarm side. Underarm snatches their wrist, so overarm gets the V shape<br/>/
			Then other hand goes round, keep head on side of bicep grab. <br/>
			If fall on weak underarm side -> top hand hug and grab his shoulder and pick them up to free underarm hand. Pick him<br/>
			up towards you and use hooks to help. As drop back down, underarm becomes V, head transfers side + choke. <br/>
			Rule - Whatever side your fall on - that arm becomes the V.

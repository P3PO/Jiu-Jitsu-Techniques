		</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<p> kite attack. bring outstretched leg out. 
			when he has one knee up. put your leg on ground other leg. can also kick his knee back. henrique lima attack too. 
			<br/>always try to stand up when youre ontop. 
			stomping triangle - he standing. outstretched leg let his bicep slip. other leg, bridge off. use your clamped leg as base to let yourself hang. use both of his arms in other direction. then switch legs in other direction to go into triangle. need to switch hips sharply in other direction. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Triangle Submission Chain:<br/>
			Get him into triangle position from basic double bicep spider guard.<br/>Left leg over his shoulder. His Left arm through. Basic triangle position<br/>
			Raise hips, use crossarm to move his left arm across his body(grab his tricep behind), then immediately use your right arm to grab his head down. <br/> Switch so left arm is holding their head down. Then right arm can grab your left leg. Then put your right leg on their hip. Can use foot on their hip to rotate, and can even put it on the ground to rotate even further. <br/>Left arm under their right leg(palm towars you open) and pull yourself towards them to turn even more. To eliminate space that was created when turning, <br/>
			use your right hand to control their head towards you and kick forward with your leg. Flex both feet, bring heels to your butt and move right leg in clockwise direction down. Pull down on the head and lift the hips. <br/>
			can raise both legs and scissor to make righter. Can hold your leg and pull it down before triangling your legs. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Big Boy Triangle: <br/>
			Good against bigger person. Hard to get the side angle so use Big Boy triangle - don't change angle. <br/>
			After grab your leg and put your foot on their hips. Use foot to kick back and move back - create space. Triangle legs and apply the triangle. Prevents them from taking your side when changing angle. <b>Block their shoulder or your knee with left arm.</b> when holding your leg and have foot on their hip. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Triangle Armbar: <br/>
			If doing triangle and not working. Take their left arm. Traditional armbar - thumb up. In this triangle armbar, use both your arms to rotate their hand - <b>palm faces the sky. </b>Stops them bending their elbow to the side. So as lift hips, drive hips to the left side to stop them bending their arm. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Wristlock: <br/>
			vs their left arm when in triangle. Lift hips and hold their wrist. Kimura style grip. Your left hand grabs the top of their wrist(base knuckles of their hand). Your right hand goes under and grabs your left wrist. Use your right leg to reinforce and keep tight so they cant move their arm to the side. Can straighten into normal straight armbar if too much resistance. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Inverse Armbars: <br/>
			When gap between their arm and hip. Can attack either arm. Attacking their right arm, pass your left arm under, palm up, over their elbow. Slide their hand over your left shoulder on side of your neck. Left palm grab your right palm. Ear press to your shoulder. Raise your  elbow up. Pull down. If not working. Use right arm to go around and bring their arm over and have both hands on their elbow. <br/>
			Can also attack inside arm. <br/>
			Their defence is to turn wrist and bring thumb up. Drill from closed guard: <br/>
			Inverse armbar on them. They defend by turning thumb. List hips, crossarm, move their arm to the other side. And arm that was doing armbar grabs their back. Then inverse armbar their other arm. <br/>
			If doing inverse armbar and they defend, can do the switch and do the triangle. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Kimura : <br/>
			Grab their right wrist with your left hand. Move your hips to the left. Raise their arm, reach over and start Kimura. 
			To attack their left arm, sit up and grab. If can't grab all the way over, can pull down on their elbow as you raise their wrist. <br/>
			Kimura - throttle your wrist, e.g. Henrique Lima fuksau position. Switch your hips so can turn all your hip into it. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Armbar vs Posture: <br/>
			When they posture up in triangle.Keep left leg strong. Swing right leg over his head. Regular armbar rule of thumb - thumb points to ceiling. Can cross ankles to reinforce keeping their posture down. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Knock-backs vs Posture: <br/>
			If they posture, can do regular armbar above. However, when they posture and move back, so left leg isnt tight anymore, they can slip their arm out.Also if they grab your belt its difficult. <br/>
			Put your hands behind your head on the ground and push off the ground to get up onto a mounted triangle. Will be on wrong side for a triangle. Use left hand to lift their head. Other hand on floor for support. squeeze knees. Switch legs. Then switch hands to lock triangle. <br/>
			3 finishes: shin twist, move hips to the right. Or put your head on the floor at quite a distance away and raise their head with your hands. Can also attack the arm/wrist. 3 - can also sit back and put all weight on part of thigh on his neck. 
			<br/> When switching legs. After switched legs, switch hands and kick with your leg to remove any space. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Punch choke vs hidden arm: <br/>
			When opponent defends triangle by putting arm hidden behind your leg. 
			Make a stiff straight arm karate fist into the side of his neck and bring your legs/thighs into your fist. If have triangle locked on, even more painful. <br/>
			Attack the side of their neck - 45degrees on their artery. Bring knees into your chest. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Teepee vs hidden arm: <br/>
			You have him in triangle. He defends with hidden arm. Unlock your triangle but keep feet hooked. Wrap your arms around your legs. Hand that goes around leg where he's hiding arm goes under facing away from you. 10 finger grip, C-clamp. Straighten legs up Squeeze your knees in by extending arms, bringing elbows in. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Transition to Omoplata vs Hidden arm:<br/>Better not to lose the triangle. But if want to switch, as soon as they hide their arm behind, can attack the omoplata. <br/>
			Bring your arms and head to the right and legs to the left switching angle. Left hand goes to wrist, right arm blocks their back. Left foot can go on ground or on their shoulder, and right leg then straightens down to bring their shoulder to the floor. <br/>
			Can scoop back and sit up, or roll away and go into omoplata. Lift hips to finish. 


		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Troubleshooting the triangle:<br/>
			If you have triangle and they start stacking you. As they walk forward, they're trying to get hips over your shoulder. Lift one shoulder and perch, then lift the other shoulder and perch to keep moving back. <br/>
			Or as they're going forward, use their momentum, can reach under their leg and switch angle to the side. <br/>
			When switching angle in triangle, if they kick their leg back, can use their arm to rotate to the side (back of their arm). Can also attack it inverse armbar. They might then bring their leg back to get back their base, so can then go under their leg again. <br/>
			46:29 - good triangle escape.<br/>
			Use both hands on their leg. Fall to the side and sprawl. <br/> To prevent it, can start attacking their arm, peel the arm out and start armbaring. Switch to the side using their leg or arm - dont allow them to get to the side. <br/>
			If they get to the side, attack their arm/wrist. 
			48 mins - good switch into neil adams triangle turn. <br/>



		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> OmoPlata: <br/>
			Spider guard, double bicep, stomp off their left leg, raise hips , right leg behind their arm. <br/>
			Keep holding both their arms. Right leg kick to the ground. Release left hand, left hand grab their wrist and right arm blocks their back. <br/>
			Make sure their wrist stays between your knee and ribs. Lift hips in order to get your knee onto the ground. <br/>
			Release left hand just before all the way down. <br/>
			Can use right hand to grab their leg and spread them out as shrimp to the side. Or can just sit up. <br/>
			To sit up, go back and sit up. 2 - circle away and sit up. 3 - just swing your leg to sit up (if he's flat). 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Omoplata finish follow ups: <br/>
			If having tough time finishing, can attack the wrist. Press down on back of their wrist to finish. <br/>
			TIP - best to have your calf under their tricep. <br/>
			Bring their arm back if its slipping to the side. <br/>
			If losing it, left arm goes under their neck. Switch to side-back. Left knee on ground, right knee on their hip. <br/>
			When on back-side, they're flat and switching to knees. Right knee on their hip. Don't make leg go over to take gap, let left leg hook in, and drag them back. Grab cross gi, bring elbow back, 


		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> The Rack: <br/>
			Normal omoplata, triangle your legs. Right leg under left leg. Left foot under their armpit. Important to get hips to the side + straighten both legs. Hips shrimped away from them -> so can't air guitar away. <br/>
			From spider guard, can keep very tight, from bicep to under armpit. <br/>
			Can also be at 90 degrees and walk backwards. If they defend, can move into regular omoplata. <br/>
			If they're standing, can use the rack, put left foot under their knee. Can attack their wrist. Let go off rack if they start falling backwards for safety.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Situp vs Roll: <br/>
			If get them into omoplata, and they roll. Use your right hand on outside of their legs. Sit up, bring arm under your leg and sit on it. Armbar + wristlock. Use left arm to grab their arm, lift up, left leg step back. List their head and go into mounted triangle. <br/>
			When going into mounted triangle, need to lift up, and switch hips. Bring hip down so leg can go deep. <br/>

	<li>
		<p> Spider guard entry from closed guard: <br/>
			Open your guard. Keep your legs straight on their hips. This gives them a lot less space and keeps weight on opponent the whole time. Shrimp to the side, then the other side keeping legs on their thighs. Put them onto NO-Gi spider guard, shrimp a bit and into double bicep spider guard. 
			<br/>Situation 2. If he puts one knee on your tailbone and other leg out. whatever side his leg is back, shrimp that way first and bring that side knee in. 
			<br/>
			If he stands, open and put feet on biceps. If he's too ontop of you, can sometimes put feet on their hips and push them back. 
			<br/>
			If he stands and moves one leg back, make sure you bring the knee first which is the side he has brought the leg back. Keep knees in so opponent can't pin knees down. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Spider guard from basic guard pull:<br/>
			Normal Judo grip. Right hand on lapel, left hand on elbow. Right foot on opponents hip, same side as lapel grip. As fall down, fall to your right side shoulder. Strong pull breaks their posture. Can swing left foot around for armbar immediately. <br/>
			Or can swing left foot round to de la riva guard, left leg wrapping round his right leg. Can then switch right foot to opponents left shoulder and push it back. Opponents wont accept so will bring arm in to control leg. Can then grab their arm and put foot on the bicep. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> De la Riva Williams Twist: <br/>
			THIS IS A GOOD MOVE !!!
			Opponent is standing, you on the ground, with double bicep spider guard.Right leg kicks their hip back, can then swing left leg round into de la riva. Swing hips too to get a good angle.  Move your hips to the side and hook tightly to get a good dela riva hook. Pull opponent forward and cross their arms, and just fall to your side. Kick him back a bit first, then release that pressure when you're pulling them forward. <br/>
			When they fall they'll be on their side. Take knees off the ground, flatten out and pin him down with your hips. Pin down their top knee. Put your head right under their chin. Can use your lef to hook their ankle then move towards side control. right leg hooks their right leg, then take side control
			Can also hold their top knee down with your hand as you take side control. Important to pin their top knee down, otherwise they can hook you and retake guard as you try to pass. 
			<br/>Dope mount. Or if his legs are in good position to put you in guard, ride his legs as he turns to take side control. 
			<br/>
			If you mount them and they go onto their side, or take your leg. Stretch your knees out and go back, pancake out and then go forward again.

			Stretch them out, pull them in, and sweep them to the side. When on the ground, 2 ways to finish. 1:  keep de la riva, pull arms, and move left leg round to a knee cut pass with right leg stretched out. 2- Or grab collar and knee, stretch them out and take side control.  
			<br/>
			GOOD: !!!
			Do the guard pull where step diagonally, swing them round and pull them in de la riva, can then throw them by going into this sumi-gaeshi-like sweep. Don't do this too quickly. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> De la Riva Curtain Sweep: <br/>
			Good move!!!
			Opponent standing. Kick right hip back, left leg into de la riva. 
			TIP: If opponent to the side of hook leg, use sit down sweep. If they're square or leaning towards the other side, can use Williams Twist or this curtain sweep. <br/>
			As kick with your right leg and sit up at the same time. Reach behind their right leg with your left arm and grab their left sleeve. Grab their left collar with your right arm. Let right leg bend and pull opponent ontop of you. Fall to the side.  When reaching around his leg, go over your leg, not under. Right hand on their collar pulls straight down. Go slowly as they can't base. <br/>
			Can also do this move when they are on one knee. <br/>
			Sometimes, when try to grab their sleeve, they pull it back. Change to kneebar sweep, move legs into omoplata type position. Raise your hips, open your chest to hyperextend their leg. 
			<br/>
			Sometimes, when sit up, they've already pulled their arm back and cant grab it at all. So instead grab their belt or part of gi undernearth their belt. Grab both belt strips if possible. Twirl underneath, bring your head to opponents knee, and right arm under their leg and sweep them to the side. Sometimes, they put their arms out to stop the sweep, so bridge in the other direction and sweep him in the other direction. <br/>
			Tip: keep strong upward posture when sitting up, and keep glued to his knee you've got the arm around. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Romulo Kite Sweep: <br/>
			Useful when one leg is between their legs. Have one side bicep spider guard. Kite sweep, but instead of using your leg to block their leg, use your hand on their knee to block them. Sometimes they base strong and dont get swept, so go onto your knees and use hand on their knee to sweep them to the side. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Advanced Balloon sweep concepts: <br/>
			Learn how to do a power reverse shoulder roll! Adds power to the baloon sweep. <br/>
			Sometimes, you try to do baloon sweep and they lean back so you can't pull them forward. So jump your arse right between their legs - under their centre of gravity and then do the sweep. <br/>
			Can sometimes do baloon sweep in this way when you're both on the ground. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Balloon Sweep Armbar: <br/>
			Difficult to do:
			When doing balloon sweep, they put their arms out to stop the sweep. Keep weight on right foot. Take weight off left foot and swing it around and into an armbar. <br/>
			Sometimes can just push straight into an armbar. Sometimes they are in turtle.If they stack you, use the Neil Adams squishy turn. <br/>
			No gi version, arms around them, butterfly feet, then go into balloon sweep. 

		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Slingshot Sweep: <br/>
			!!! VERY GOOD SWEEP !!!
			Double bicep spider guard. Change so only control their right arm. Put your right foot across on their right side, with knee across their body like a shield. This can make them want to pass to your right side. <br/>
			Lift your hips and push them to your right. They will recoil to the left. Tutn 90 degrees. Pull your left arm and leg to your left side towards your chest. Right shin still across their hip. Right hand underhook their leg or grab outside of their leg. Then push them to the side. Right hand grabs near bottom of their trousers palm up. Pull your head to opponents knee and use grib on their trouser to punch to the sky.

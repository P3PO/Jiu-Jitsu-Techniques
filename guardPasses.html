<p> Guard Passes </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Useful when opponent has one leg between your knees: </b> <br/>
			You are on your knees and he is on his back. He has his right leg between your knees and left leg on the floor or <br/>
			over your back guard-like. Put your arms infront and use your elbows to close his hips. Put weight on your left elbow <br/>
			and stretch your right leg back and then bring it forward so his leg is across your belly.  <br/>
			<b>Option 1: </b> Use left hand to push his right knee down. Left leg go over, right hand under his left armpit <br/>
			then bring left knee down and close his leg outside. Left hand under his head, switch base and into side control. <br/>
			<b>Option 2: </b> Use right hand to grab his foot. Lift hips, both legs out, keep pressure down. Bring right leg under  <br/>
			into kesa gatame legs then side control. Keep pressure + hold foot all the way through. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> <b>Classic method: </b> Right arm control his left sleeve. Left arm control his left wrist. Right leg up. Left leg up.<br/>
			Straighten up standing, keep holding his left arm, with elbow in. Step back with your left leg as push on his right knee <br/>
			with your left hand. Left leg step over. Right arm go under his left leg. Left arm control his head. Switch base and into side <br/>
			control. Tip: Control arm, take first step. Second step, push off knee to get off floor -> keep pressure on them, then step forward. <br/>
			When put arm around leg - control middle of leg + keep face pressure when switch hip. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> <b>Classic method Variation: </b> Like the classic method, but when push knee down, don't step back. Instead, push knee down <br/>
			on the ground. Keep toes within his legs to avoid half guard. <br/>
			Option 1: Put your arm round his leg and head. Control body down, hip down for good base. Pass leg over, then 2nd leg. <br/>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Put your right knee at the centre of his butt. Both hands on his hips, left leg sprawl back and look in that direction <br/>
			Right knee over his leg. Then other knee over and side control. Or control leg and head and switch base and then into side control. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> (Train this both sides) Both palms facing down. Control one knee and leg, circle to the side. e.g. control his left leg and go to the right <br/>
			When left leg at knee level, switch hands, left hand on knee, right hand to his collar(back of the head). As he turns towards you <br/>
			be like a truck and smash into his chest with your shoulder. Pull his leg right over. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Grab both knees inside. 1 elbow goes in. e.g. Right elbow goes inside. Left knee goes down over his leg. Use elbow to put his leg <br/>
			on your shoulder. Grab around his leg  on his neck palm down. Other hand keeps his knee down. Go round, keeping pressure on his <br/>
			waist. Careful he doesn't get arm that keeps your knee down or he can triangle you. As go round, neck hand - elbow on ground. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> You in his guard. Get his lapels out and push at his armpits, grabbing lapels at armpit level, so he cant grab your legs. <br/>
			Stand up. Bring knees together, sit back. Left leg back, right knee in the middle of his legs. Push his right leg back <br/>
			and step over. Right arm underarm, left arm control arm - kesa gatame legs. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Both hands underarm his legs. Both hands on his lapels. Push forward. Your chest on his arse, pick side, follow him and take back. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Do leg drag. Put your knee over his other knee. Grab belt + keep elbow closed. Control head, switch hips  into side control.
		</p>

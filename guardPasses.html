<p> Guard Passes </p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b>Useful when opponent has one leg between your knees: </b> <br/>
			You are on your knees and he is on his back. He has his right leg between your knees and left leg on the floor or <br/>
			over your back guard-like. Put your arms infront and use your elbows to close his hips. Put weight on your left elbow <br/>
			and stretch your right leg back and then bring it forward so his leg is across your belly.  <br/>
			<b>Option 1: </b> Use left hand to push his right knee down. Left leg go over, right hand under his left armpit <br/>
			then bring left knee down and close his leg outside. Left hand under his head, switch base and into side control. <br/>
			<b>Option 2: </b> Use right hand to grab his foot. Lift hips, both legs out, keep pressure down. Bring right leg under  <br/>
			into kesa gatame legs then side control. Keep pressure + hold foot all the way through. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> <b>Classic method: </b> Right arm control his left sleeve. Left arm control his left wrist. Right leg up. Left leg up.<br/>
			Straighten up standing, keep holding his left arm, with elbow in. Step back with your left leg as push on his right knee <br/>
			with your left hand. Left leg step over. Right arm go under his left leg. Left arm control his head. Switch base and into side <br/>
			control. Tip: Control arm, take first step. Second step, push off knee to get off floor -> keep pressure on them, then step forward. <br/>
			When put arm around leg - control middle of leg + keep face pressure when switch hip. When putting hand round his head <br/>
			pull him to you first and then press shoulder onto their face. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> <b>Classic method Variation: </b> Like the classic method, but when push knee down, don't step back. Instead, push knee down <br/>
			on the ground. Keep toes within his legs to avoid half guard!!! <br/>
			Option 1: Put your arm round his leg and head. Control body down, hip down for good base. Pass leg over, then 2nd leg. <br/>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Put your right knee at the centre of his butt. Both hands on his hips, left leg sprawl back and look in that direction <br/>
			Right knee over his leg. Then other knee over and side control. Or control leg and head and switch base and then into side control. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> (Train this both sides) Both palms facing down. Control one knee and leg, circle to the side. e.g. control his left leg and go to the right <br/>
			When left leg at knee level, switch hands, left hand on knee, right hand to his collar(back of the head). As he turns towards you <br/>
			be like a truck and smash into his chest with your shoulder. Pull his leg right over. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Grab both knees inside. 1 elbow goes in. e.g. Right elbow goes inside. Left knee goes down over his leg. Use elbow to put his leg <br/>
			on your shoulder. Grab around his leg  on his neck palm down. Other hand keeps his knee down. Go round, keeping pressure on his <br/>
			waist. Careful he doesn't get arm that keeps your knee down or he can triangle you. As go round, neck hand - elbow on ground. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> You in his guard. Get his lapels out and push at his armpits, grabbing lapels at armpit level, so he cant grab your legs. <br/>
			Stand up. Bring knees together, sit back. Left leg back, right knee in the middle of his legs. Push his right leg back <br/>
			and step over. Right arm underarm, left arm control arm - kesa gatame legs. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Both hands underarm his legs. Both hands on his lapels. Push forward. Your chest on his arse, pick side, follow him and take back. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Do leg drag. Put your knee over his other knee. Grab belt + keep elbow closed. Control head, switch hips  into side control.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> He sits in front of you with feet between your legs and double underhook. Left hand grab outside of his right knee. <br/>
			Right arm go deep over his shoulder to his belt. Left leg up, right knee down. Swing left leg to side to change base whilst<br/>
			opening up his right knee away from you and then sidemount. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Opponent has you in guard. (works very well when they're trying to grab your cross lapel).Take their gi out belt. <br/>
			Move gi over their right arm. Keep head on their body. Move forward with hips, open legs. Pass gi under them and grab with <br/>
			your right hand. Their right arm should now be trapped. Should now be able to open their guard. Can stand up and open if they're too strong. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> His back on the floor, legs up. You want to pass his guard. Left hand on his right knee, right hand on his belly. Try to pass <br/>
			to your left (his right side). Left leg open. Right knee try to go over his right knee. He tries to trap you in half guard. <br/>
			Option 1: If can get your right arm underarm his left arm. Put your head on the floor left of his head. Left hand grab his arm <br/>
			then Sousa escape. <br/>
			Option 2: If can't get underarm, right arm around his head over his arm. Left leg goes over to other side of his body. <br/>
			Switch your base. Left hand grab his right knee and bring it down. Move hip down, careful he doesn't sweep. Then left leg over into mount <br/>
			Once in mount, posture up, use both your hands to put his arms on his chest. If opponent is still half-guarding your right leg, <br/>
			left leg go over his head to your right. Hip low, left arm underarm his right arm. Go forward, kuzure kesa gatame to escape half guard.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> You in guard. Left leg steps to the side. Right leg then go forward and to the side, so end up kuzure kesa gatame legs. Right arm underarm. <br/>
			Never over the head or they will take the back. Left hand can be controlling knee as go around. Step deep so they get turned to the side<br/>
			.If their right leg is under in guard, your left leg can go over their leg and push their leg. If their right foot is over, can move your left<br/>
			infront of their legs and then swing leg back. 
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> Right hand control both their lapels. Left hand on their right hip. Put right knee in middle of their butt. <br/>
		Go back with your body. Can press on their right knee to break their guard if needed.  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>!!!!GOOD ONE!!! Julian Lesson. Tip 1 - when on the top, keep on your toes, don't be flat footed. To prevent injury + <br/>
			react quicker. When you on top and they on the ground and they try to get underarm, can crossarm on their neck and <br/>
			push them back. There is a counterattack: They get underarm under your right armpit. Your right hand on their upper back<br/>
			. Left arm grab under their legs and control both at the knee. Left leg back, steering wheel action into side control. <br/>
			Good Tip 2: when grabbing. Thumb and pinky touch. Then 3 other fingers overlap ontop. So have 4 fingers over thumb.
